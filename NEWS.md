* Simplified the single-method interface: `crossfit()` now returns `estimate`, `results`, and diagnostics directly. Method-indexed outputs remain available through `crossfit_multi()`.
* Added method-specific failure handling through `crossfit_failure_control()`, including control over whether panel errors fail a repetition, pruning after shared-fit failures, and the number of permitted failed repetitions.
* Improved nuisance-fit reuse by comparing complete function objects, including their closure environments, so learners with different captured states are not incorrectly treated as identical.
* Updated the documentation and examples to use the current output structure and clarified the terminology for evaluation windows, panels, and repetitions.
